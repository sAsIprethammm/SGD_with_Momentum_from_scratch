# SGD_with_Momentum_from_scratch

## Description

This project implements Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Momentum from scratch in Python. SGD with Momentum is an optimization algorithm that helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. This project demonstrates how the algorithm works without relying on external machine learning libraries.

## Usage

To use this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python libraries (if any, list them here)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SGD_with_Momentum_from_scratch.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd SGD_with_Momentum_from_scratch
    ```

3. Install any required dependencies (if applicable):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Project

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the appropriate directory (e.g., `data/your_data.csv`).

2. Run the Python script to see the SGD with Momentum in action:

    ```bash
    python sgd_with_momentum.py
    ```

3. The output will include the progression of the loss function and the final model parameters.

## How It Works

### Algorithm Implementation

1. **Initialization**: Initialize parameters and hyperparameters, including the learning rate and momentum factor.
2. **Gradient Calculation**: Compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter.
3. **Momentum Update**: Update the velocity term with the gradient and momentum factor.
4. **Parameter Update**: Adjust the parameters using the velocity term.
5. **Iteration**: Repeat the process for a set number of iterations or until convergence.

### Key Components

- **Learning Rate**: Controls the step size of each update.
- **Momentum Factor**: Helps smooth out the updates and accelerates convergence.
- **Velocity Term**: Keeps track of the direction and magnitude of past gradients.
